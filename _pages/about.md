Hello!/Guten Tag!/你好！
======
I graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in December 2024 with a degree in Mathematics and Statistics. My research interests focus on applied mathematics, particularly in statistical theory. I am seeking research or work opportunities in this field for Spring 2025.

I am actively applying to Applied Mathematics and Statistics graduate programs for Fall 2025. You can contact me through <a href="mailto:tchen433@wisc.edu">tchen433@wisc.edu</a>.
