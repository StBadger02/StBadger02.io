I cooperated with undergraduate students **Daniel Alexander David, Vivek Saravanan, Marissa Stolt**. The Project is mentored by **[Terry Harris](https://sites.google.com/view/terryljh/)** and graduate student **Kaiyi Huang**.

Description: The aim of the project is to find some numerical evidence for the Kakeya maximal function conjecture in 3 dimensions. This conjecture roughly states that a collection of tubes in 3-space of equal radii and separated directions is mostly disjoint. It is folklore that if the placement of each tube is random (uniform), then the conjecture is true, so we will first aim to verify this numerically (and possibly theoretically). Then, we will try to find a better way to search parameter space for counterexamples to test whether 3/2 is the correct exponent. We may also try to develop some of these approaches in 2 dimensions first, where the conjecture is known.
